# Customer_churn_ML
Customer Churn problem are analysis BY EDA (Python) 
Problem statement
 Customer churn is a concerning problem for large companies (especially in the Telecom field) Machine Learning model that predicts which of their customers are likely to churn
 (Stop using their service in future)
Key Skill: PYTHON
Task – I can start with EDA in the dataset to find out some insight information in between the feature(columns) then explore the details using BAR,SCATTER,HEATMAP, this chart are founds correlation of independent variables. BOXPLOT ,SKEWNESS to find outliers then working on outlier treatment to make it dataset to reduce their impact on statistical analysis (Winsorizing, IQR, Trimming the outliers), then I go for data balancing (Oversampling).While developing the model, you would have gotten a few candidate models which were not as good as the final model (in terms of performance, multicollinearity, or statistical stability etc.),(Model-Random Forest Classifier) check model’s performance  based on evaluation metrics (both train and test samples)- Confusion Matrix, Classification.
